# PONG
Pong is a simple game inspired by the old 1979 Atari game
## Building on Windows
1. Make sure you have the dependencies (SDL2, SDL_ttf, SDL_image)
2. Change the INCLUDE_PATHS into your SDL include path in your OS
3. Change the INCLUDE_PATHS into your SDL library path in your OS
4. Run Makefile

**Building the project in this phase may prone to errors, I recommend waiting for release build.**

## Future Updates
* Update the README
* Change the Makefile to support other OS
* Some refactoring
* Release builds
